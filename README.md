# Whirlo-RNG-Research-Resource-Dump
A place where I threw in a bunch of miscellaneous resources I used to research the RNG in Whirlo for Speedrunning purposes.

This is not something I designed for anyone to actually use. My research involved a bunch of throw-away bots and specific conditions, so while I didn't use very easy-to-replicate conditions, I figured I would at throw in the resources I used as reference, if anyone find them useful for some reason :)

The Savestates and TAS inputs files are made for a beta version of the practice hack (https://github.com/SBDWolf/Whirlo-Practice-Hack) and for the BSNESv115+ core on Bizhawk 2.9.1.
